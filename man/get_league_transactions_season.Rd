\usage{
get_league_transactions_season(
  league_id,
  tx_type = NULL,
  .progress = TRUE,
  max_weeks = 20
)
}
\arguments{
\item{league_id}{A character string representing the league ID for the
specific season}

\item{.progress}{Logical indicating whether to show progress messages.
Default is TRUE}

\item{max_weeks}{Integer specifying maximum number of weeks to check.
Default is 18 to cover regular season plus playoffs}
}
\value{
A tibble containing all transactions for the season with an
additional 'week' column indicating the week number for each transaction
}
\description{
This function retrieves all transactions for a league across all weeks
in a season by looping through each week and combining the results.
}
\details{
The function loops through weeks 1 to max_weeks, calling
otis::get_league_transactions_week() for each week with tx_type = NULL
to get all transaction types. It stops early if no transactions are
found for consecutive weeks to avoid unnecessary API calls.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get all transactions for a season
season_transactions <- get_league_transactions_season("123456789")
}
