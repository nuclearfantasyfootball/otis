\description{
This function retrieves information for a league and all of its historical
predecessor leagues by following the chain of previous_league_id values until
no more previous leagues are found.
}
\details{
The function starts with the provided league_id and follows the
previous_league_id chain backwards through time until it encounters a
league with no previous_league_id (NULL). Each league's information is
retrieved using otis::pull_league_info() and then combined into a single
tibble.
