\description{
This function retrieves all transactions for a league and all of its
historical predecessor leagues by combining pull_league_info_historical()
and get_league_transactions_season().
}
\details{
The function first calls pull_league_info_historical() to get
all historical league information, then loops through each league_id
to get all transactions for that season using get_league_transactions_season().
Results are combined with season and league identification information.
